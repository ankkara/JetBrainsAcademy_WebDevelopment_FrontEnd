CSS works with a variety of units of measurement that can help you specify the size of elements. These units can be absolute and relative. Absolute units of measurement have a fixed size.

1)PIXELS :
To specify the size of elements on the web pages intended for viewing on device screens, pixels are used more often than any other absolute units.

px defines the measurement in pixels.

p {
  height: 25px;
}

2)ABSOLUTE UNITS :
Besides pixels, there are other absolute units of measurement. You have probably seen or used some of these units outside of CSS.

cm defines the measurement in centimeters:

p {
  font-size: 10cm;
}
mm defines the measurement in millimeters (10mm = 1cm):

p {
  font-size: 100mm; /* or 10cm */
}
in defines the measurement in inches (1in = 2.54cm):

p {
  font-size: 4in; /* or 10.16cm */
}
pt defines the measurement in points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in).

p {
  font-size: 288pt; /* or 10.16cm */
}
pc defines the measurement in rations (1pc = 12pt).

p {
  font-size: 24pc; /* or 10.16cm */
}
