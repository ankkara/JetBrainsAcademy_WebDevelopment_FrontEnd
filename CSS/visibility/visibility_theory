The visibility property is intended to hide or show the element without changing the markup of the HTML document. You can set it to the following values:

visible is the default value, meaning that the element is displayed as visible.
hidden makes the element invisible.
collapse can hide rows and columns of a table, and the table will be reconstructed taking the missing elements into account. If you try to apply this value to something that is not a table element, the result will be the same as if you used hidden.
inherit will allow you to inherit the value of the parent element.
initial sets the property to its default value.
unset is basically a combination of the initial and inherit values. The unset keyword sets the property value as inherit if the property is inherited from the parent element; otherwise, the value is set as initial.
