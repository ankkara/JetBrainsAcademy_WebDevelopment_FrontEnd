Here is what the syntax of this property generally looks like:

box-element {
    box-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur-radius spread-radius color;
}
Let's take it apart and look closely at each of these parameters. We will start with two mandatory parameters:

offset-x sets the position of the shadow on the horizontal axis relative to the element. A positive value shifts the shadow to the right, while a negative value shifts it to the left.
offset-y sets the position of the shadow on the vertical axis relative to the element. A positive value shifts the shadow downwards, while a negative value shifts it upwards.
There are other parameters that are optional. Let's take a look at them:

blur-radius gives the shadow a blurry effect. The larger this value, the bigger the blur, so the shadow becomes bigger and lighter. Negative values will not have any effect.
spread-radius will make the shadow expand if its value is positive, or shrink if the value is negative. The default value is 0.
color sets the color of the shadow. If no value is defined, it will be based upon the currentcolor. This parameter is also optional.
If both parameters offset-x and offset-y are 0, the shadow is placed behind the element. If blur-radius or spread-radius are set, this will generate a blur effect on our element.

This may seem really theoretical, so let's visualize this information using an example. Note: in this example, we also added a background-color to the element for better viewing; you do not need to worry about it right now.

Take a look:

<div id="box">I want a shadow</div>
#box {
    background-color: darkred;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px lightseagreen;
}

#box {
    background-color: darkred;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px lightseagreen, -5px -5px black;
}
