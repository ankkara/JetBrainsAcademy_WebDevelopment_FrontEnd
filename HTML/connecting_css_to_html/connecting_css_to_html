1)EXTERNAL CSS: CSS styles written in a separate file are called External Style Sheets. To include External Style Sheets in an HTML document, use an unpaired <link> tag. Take a careful look at the syntax in this example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Connecting External CSS to HTML</title>
    <link rel="s<tylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>

The href attribute specifies the file's address, and the rel attribute with the stylesheet value tells the browser that we are connecting styles and not something else.

It is best to include styles inside the <head>, but this is not a hard requirement. The <link> tag will also work fine elsewhere on the page.

2)INTERNAL CSS: CSS styles can be written directly in HTML markup instead of a separate file. Such sets of styles are usually called Internal Style Sheets. They are wrapped in a paired <style> tag and must be located inside <head>:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Connecting Internal CSS to HTML</title>
        <style>
          There should be a CSS code here
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
      </body>
    </html>
