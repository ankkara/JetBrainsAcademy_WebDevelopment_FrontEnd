The HTML table is created with the <table> tag. Inside this tag, the elements of a table should be placed. Among these elements the two most important are:

1)the <tr> tag that creates a row in a table;
2)the <td> tag that creates the table cells.
Knowing these tags, you can already create a simple table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Tomato soup</td>
    <td>$3.95</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>French onion soup</td>
    <td>$4.49</td>
  </tr>
</table>

*TABLE HEADER CELL

3)The <th> tag is used to create a table header cell for rows or columns. The text inside this tag is bold and centered. Let's try to write a table header cell for your table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Main dishes</th>
    <th>Price</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tomato soup</td>
    <td>$3.95</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>French onion soup</td>
    <td>$4.49</td>
  </tr>
</table>

*CAPTION

4)In addition to a table header for rows, you can add a caption to the table itself. For this you need to use the <caption> tag. This tag is usually added after <table>, outside a row or cell:

  <table>
    <caption>Restaurant Menu</caption>
    <tr>
      <th>Main dishes</th>
      <th>Price</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tomato soup</td>
      <td>$3.95</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>French onion soup</td>
      <td>$4.49</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

*TABLE BORDERS

5)By default, the table and its cells have no visible borders, but you can set them using the border attribute. Specify as a value any positive integer that will mean the desired width of the border in pixels. For instance:

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Main dishes</th>
      <th>Price</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tomato soup</td>
      <td>$3.95</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>French onion soup</td>
      <td>$4.49</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  In the code above, we've set a border width of 1 pixel for the table:

!! Automatically, the border also applies to all the cells in your table.
Now this practice is outdated, and CSS is used for dividing the content and tables are used for their intended purpose.
