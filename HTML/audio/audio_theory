* Until recently, developers could add sound files to web pages only via <bgsound> tag. It set the audio as the background sound and played it while the user is viewing the page, giving no ability to turn it off (not cool).

* To solve this problem, a new tag <audio> was added to the fifth version of the HTML standard.

The <audio> tag is used to embed audio content into web pages. When using this tag, HTML markup looks like this:

<audio src="media/example.mp3"></audio>
or like that, using a nested <source> tag and the same audio recording in different formats:

<audio>
  <source src="media/example.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="media/example.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>

* Attributes of tags:

a) src indicates the path to the file that's played
b) controls displays the audio player control interface (playback buttons, pause, volume)
c) autoplay is responsible for automatic playback of the file immediately after the page is loaded
d) loop cycles the audio file
e) muted mutes the sound when playing an audio file

        MP3	audio/mpeg
        OGG	audio/ogg
        WAV	audio/wava
