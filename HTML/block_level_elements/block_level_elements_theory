There are two main types of page elements: block-level and inline. Each of them has its own peculiarities.

Block-level elements are mostly used to create the structure of web pages or logically divide an HTML document into parts.
Here are some examples of block elements:

* <div> is a universal content divider. It is used to group similar HTML elements:
<div>
  <h1>Element h1 is inside the div</h1>
  <p>Element p is also inside the div</p>
</div>

* <h1>-<h6> are heading tags:
<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading level 6</h6>

* <p> defines a paragraph of text:
 <p>It's a paragraph of the text</p>
 <p>And this is another paragraph</p>

* <pre> defines a block of formatted text.
