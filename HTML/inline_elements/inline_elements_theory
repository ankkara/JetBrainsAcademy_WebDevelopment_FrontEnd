* Inline elements are those elements of a document that are a direct part of a line. They are intended to emphasize
some part of the text and give it a certain function/meaning; they usually contain one or more words.

examples:

1) <a> tag => <a> tag is probably one of the most important elements of HTML;
it's designed to create links. This tag is often used with the href attribute, which indicates the path to the file/webpage referenced. Consider a code sample that takes us to the JetBrains website:

              <a href="https://jetbrains.com">Click here to access the JetBrains website!</a>

2) <span> tag => In the paired tag <span> you can wrap the text or part of it.

                 <p>For the first time <span>on our site</span>?</p>
                 <span>Sign up now!</span>
                 This tag does not affect the display of text in any way:

You probably have a logical question: why and in what situations use this tag? The <span> tag is often used when you need to change the appearance of a part of text using CSS.
CSS is the language used to describe the appearance of web pages.

3) <button> tag => In order to create a clickable button, there is a paired <button> tag. Inside it, you can put the text that will be displayed inside the button:

                   <button>Click</button>

4) <b> tag => This paired tag sets a bold font for any text enclosed in it.
This is rather straightforward, so let's proceed to the example. The limits of the text are indicated by the <p> tag; the outline of a name and surname of a person is changed:

              <p>I'm <b>John Doe</b>, and what's your name?</p>

5) <sub> tag => This tag is used to create subscript text:
that is, the text inside this paired tag will be shifted down and reduced in size. Let's see how it works:

                <p>The formula of water is H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

6) <sup> tag => This tag defines superscript text.
It is similar to the previous one, except that the text enclosed in this tag will be shifted upwards:

                <p>x<sup>2</sup> = 4</p>
