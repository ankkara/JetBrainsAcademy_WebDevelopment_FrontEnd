*To connect JavaScript files to an HTML document, use the paired tag <script> with the attribute src.
In the attribute, a path to the necessary file is specified.

<script src="assets/js/main.js"></script>

//The difference does in fact exist. It is recommended to enable JavaScript at the end of the <body> section
since this type of connection allows you to speed up the loading of the page. Web pages are loaded in the
order specified in HTML markup: first, the browser analyzes the elements inside the <head> tag and then goes
to <body>. If you use the connection in the <head> tag, the page content will not be visible in the browser
until the JavaScript file is loaded. The situation may become critical with larger files. The priority here
is to show the basic information posted on the web page so that the user does not sit looking at a blank screen monitor for a long time.

* Internal script => JS code can also be written directly in HTML, not in a separate file.
To do this, just enclose the JS code in a paired <script> tag.
