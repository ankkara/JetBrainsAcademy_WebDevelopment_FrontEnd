Basic tags in HTML: Tue structure can be divided into three main sections:
1) <html>
2) <head>
3) <body>

example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Page title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>

*element <!DOCTYPE> specifies the type of the current document: DTD (Document Type Definition).

*the <meta> tag with attribute charset specifies document coding.
If it is not specified, some browsers may display obscure characters instead of the text;

*the <html> tag indicates that it is an HTML document;

*the <head> tag is designed to store elements that help the browser and search engines to work with data;

*the <title> contains the HTML document header. Even though this tag is not mandatory, it is still present
on almost all web pages on the Internet;

*the <body> tag defines the page content area. It wraps the content displayed in the main browser window;

*the <h1> tag holds the page title within the body, and the <p> tag is responsible for the paragraphs.
These tags are not the main sections and provided here as an example, but you're likely to find
them useful in the future as you move from basic to artsy.
