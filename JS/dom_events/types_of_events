Mouse events occur when the user interacts with the mouse. The most popular ones are:

* click when the user clicks the left mouse button;
* contextmenu when the user clicks the right mouse button;
* dblclick when the user clicks the left mouse button twice;
* mouseenter when the user moves the mouse pointer towards the element;
* mouseleave when the user moves the mouse pointer away from the element.

Keyboard events are the results of the user's interaction with the keyboard. There are three types of such events:

* keydown when the user presses any key;
* keypress when the user presses any key except Shift, Fn, or CapsLock;
* keyup when the user releases a key.

Focus events occur when an element receives or loses focus. This is especially useful for input when developers mark the
incorrectly filled input field in red, such as the email or phone fields.

* focus when an element receives focus;
* blur when an element looses focus.
