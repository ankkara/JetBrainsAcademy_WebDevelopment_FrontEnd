* Not only HTML allows you to create DOM elements: it can also be done with JavaScript. An Audio Object can be created by using the following syntax:

let audio = document.createElement("AUDIO");

You can also create audio objects using the new Audio() construction:

let audio = new Audio("path/to/myAudio.mp3");

* Just as with any other object, access to the properties of an Audio Object is obtained through a point. Let's take a look at the basic properties of the given object:

let audio = getElementById("myObjectID");
let src = audio.src;
console.log(src);

* The duration property lets us know the duration of the audio file in seconds:

let duration = audio.duration;
console.log(duration);

* Now let's consider some Audio Object methods. The following method is responsible for reloading the <audio> element:

audio.load();
The following methods are probably the most basic ones:

audio.play();
audio.pause();
